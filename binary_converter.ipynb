1.Camera is also the best as always.Big Display (6.5 inch).Brightness and display quality is also good.Big Battery (6000 mAh).Camera is decent.As always Samsung camera is very good.Pros: Efficient battery.It doesn't go well with gaming though Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress Cons: Mediocre camera for this segment.This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.6000mah battery might not as good as others.Quad camera set is is just okay.But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range.The display is fine.And with a good selfie and main camera.Review after 3 month of use: 1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark.4/5 2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .Very well balanced phone - Camera, Battery, Display & Antennas - best in this budget.For a regular use, this phone is nice with good battery and camera.Very good Shape nice battery, performance is okay.Battery backup , camera and storage all are fantastic.Ph is looking good & camera is awesome but some features are missing as per the comparison of MI 9 PRIME & let me see in future how is it work ?Its battery backup is awesome.Pretty good camera and everything at all nice phone.1st time using Samsung and the experience is awesome nice phone with big battery and nice camera and awesome performance.The software experience is also great.Sumsung love | f12 camera quality is very good | is sumsung branding is very super #sumsung f12 is full hd display | proccer is fast speed | smooth display 90hz | best quality speaker | super sound quality | mobile size is very good---thanks flipkart (love you sumsung f12) battery backup is very best.Awesome product & I have ordered this product on the 1st day,its performance is good & battery is also good,its look also good but this model similar to galaxy A12, M12.Camera is very good and best is battery this phone can be used for 2 days without charging Today after using 3 hours this phone consume only 5 percent battery and with very fast charging And I bought this phone only at 7500BATTERY 🔋 is awesome 😉 take a long time to drain and Runs 1 day with full charge .Gaming performance is still good but not much.Like BGMI you play at low graphics then performance of this mobile is too good.Selfie camera is not much good as expected.Main camera is ok.The 90hz display performs like pro.Very very fast response of screen.Battery lasts whole day long for online classes.The best phone among all on this price range Camera is awesome.Battery is monster.Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK.The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark.The selfish camera is better.Battery lasts upto 1 day even on continuous use but it takes time for charging.Display is amazing.Adaptive 90hz display is very smooth, but consumes a little amount of charge.Fingerprint sensor is really fast.Call connectivity and quality is really good as all Samsung phones .You use it as a secondary phone not primary And the pros are 1 big battery 2 big storage 3 processor is all right Cons 1 display not that good 2 camera is ok not upto the mark 3 audio is not upto the mark You can go for micromax in note 1, it's far better than thisCamera quality - good Display - good Performance - good except sometimes there is issue in call connecting .Battery - good as well as fast charging.Face unlock- slow Fingerprint unlock - average.Camera is not as per expectations,there is nothing like 48MP quality in clicked images,performance of front camera is also not good.Performance is good in this price range,battery is awesome and display is ok.Phone seems good right now but it is heavy maybe due to big size.Charging takes a lot of time but the battery backup is good.Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good.Camera is also reasonably good.Good phone with Good Performance Back camera is good and front is average Battery backup is too good !6000 mh battery last long for almost 1 day of use!ii) Very nice interface, easy to use, 90 Hz refresh rate.iii) 6000mAh battery back up is too good for heavy use.Cons: i) Front camera is very average in quality.ii) Little bit heavy due to 6000mAh battery.iii) Sound quality is comparatively low with other smartphones.Overall Satisfied 👍👍 Pros: 1.Big Display + Good build quality 2.Sharp Colors 3.Good battery backup lasts for almost 1.5 days 4.Smooth touch + clean UIRear camera works pretty good in day light Cons: 1.Front camera is averageIt's a very nice budget phone 5/5 💥💥💥💥💥👍 Camera performance is very good 5/5 💥💥💥💥💥👍 Battery backup really very good 5/5 💥💥💥💥💥👍 The display is also very good 5/5 💥💥💥💥💥👍 Quality of product & finishing's too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easily accessible.Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features.Camera is well .1.  camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update).Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use.Samsung f12 best build quality,heavy battery life,Knox security, advertisement free system,no heating issue,fast charging,no lag,unloacking very fast,90 hz display is more better than full HD display of Chinese phone,Dolby atmos audio.very thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad .\",\n",
